# evaluatePostfix

Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)) and returns the result. The expression will contain single-digit integers and the operators +, -, \*, and /. You can assume the input is always a valid expression!

## Example

```js
evaluatePostfix('12+') > 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*') > 77
```
